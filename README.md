## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
With my primary focus being the study of information security, and web experience focused on observation and manipulation, rather than development, I wasn’t expecting the assignment to be particularly difficult, but I did expect it to take significantly longer than it did. I cannot say, though, with the detailed and thorough instructions provided, that the assignment posed much of a challenge or much of a time commitment. Probably the most difficult part, between work, school, additional coursework, and family, was finding the time to sit down and knock it out, but that was overcome, as is often the case, with simple force of will combined with liberal amounts of black coffee.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
As a more security-oriented individual, I would be curious to see how considerations of such fit into the workflow of the average web developer operating in the corporate environment, and in particular, whether a wholistic approach to security is taken, or it is essentially tacked on as an afterthought. I tend to make assumptions based on what I have observed in source, but I feel I won’t truly understand until I get a chance to participate in the process myself.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I were to have additional time to invest in this project, some difficulty sliders or toggles may be a worthwhile addition. One may either allow the user access to easy, medium, and hard presets, or implement more granular controls for speed and number of targets. Under the former, I could also see it making sense to play infinite rounds until the point of failure, and hosting leaderboards for each respective difficulty level.
